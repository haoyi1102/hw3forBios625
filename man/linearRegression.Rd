\usage{
linearRegression(outcome_name, predictor_name, data, plot = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{outcome_name}{The name of the outcome variable in the dataset.}

\item{predictor_name}{The name of the predictor variable in the dataset.}

\item{data}{The dataset containing the variables.}

\item{plot}{Logical, whether to plot the residuals. If TRUE, creates a plot
showing the difference between studentized and standardized residuals
against standardized residuals. The size of the dots in the plot
depends on the leverage value for each observation.}
}
\value{
A list containing the following components:
  - Residuals: A numeric vector of five summary statistics of residuals (min, 1Q, median, 3Q, max).
  - Coefficients: A dataframe with estimates, standard errors, t-values, and p-values of the coefficients.
  - `Multiple R-squared`: The R-squared value of the model.
  - `F-statistic`: The F-statistic value of the model.
  - `p-value`: The p-value associated with the F-statistic.
}
\description{
This function performs a linear regression analysis on a given dataset.
It takes an outcome variable and a predictor variable from the dataset
and calculates the linear regression coefficients, residuals, standard errors,
t-values, p-values, multiple R-squared, F-statistic, and p-value for the F-statistic.
If the 'plot' parameter is set to TRUE, it also creates a plot of the
difference between studentized and standardized residuals versus
the standardized residuals.
